"As a response to the advancement in Technology and the growing number of students who want to pursue a career in Computer Science and Information Technology, the Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU) established the College of Computer Studies (CCS) in 1996. OLFU invested in modern systems & equipment, classrooms, computers, robotic laboratories and instructors to provide the optimum learning experience to its students. The curriculum continuously develops to train students in the fields of system and web development, multimedia, digital design, networking, cyber security, and computing solutions. Today, students of the College of Computer Studies reap the full benefits from OLFU’s world-class learning platforms and resources which are paired with state-of-the-art facilities and laboratories—all delivered by a competent teaching faculty through a masterful mix of learning modalities: online, distance or, when health conditions permit, face-to-face learning. It is also noteworthy that OLFU is one among a few select schools to be granted the Certificate of Authority by the CHEd, allowing it to conduct limited face-to-face classes in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic;  a testament to the Universitys established and effective community safety protocols. CCS Students will expect two culminating requirements:  the practicum and the thesis/capstone project. The “Practicum” refers to industry-needs-aligned On-the-Job Training exposure, where a wide range of internship partners is made available. This equips the CCS graduates to be ready for the demands of the corporate world. On the other hand, the “Thesis/Capstone Project” will be the application of the underlying concepts and theories learned throughout the curricula of the said degree programs.",what is ccs,0,46
